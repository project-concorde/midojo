# MiDojo

*Red-team agents where they run.*

MiDojo (mid-dojo) lets you red-team your agent by putting a controlled environment and fake tools *in the middle* between the agent and the real world. The environment carries injection payloads spliced into otherwise-normal data — the agent encounters attacks as a side effect of doing legitimate work, the way real prompt injections land. Fake tools read from this environment (delivering the injection) and write back to it (capturing malicious actions), optionally forwarding to real tools for authentic data. MiDojo then grades **utility** (did the agent complete its task?) and **security** (did it resist the injection?). Inspired by [AgentDojo](https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo).

## What can you test?

MiDojo helps you answer three questions about your agent's robustness:

1. **Will my agent do something unintended if a data source it reads from is compromised?**
   Data-source injection — the tool itself is faithful, but the upstream data has been poisoned. The agent has no way to distinguish legitimate content from injected instructions.

2. **Will my agent do something unintended if a tool it calls is compromised?**
   Tool-mediated injection — a fake tool returns real data with an attack payload spliced in. The agent encounters the injection as a side effect of doing legitimate work.

3. **Will my agent do something unintended if I give it a malicious prompt?**
   Direct prompt injection — feed an attack payload as the agent's input. Tools like [garak](https://github.com/NVIDIA/garak) cover this too, but MiDojo can verify not just the agent's output but also modifications to the environment state (eg., did it actually delete that file?).

## If your agent...

- **speaks [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)** — author a fake MCP server with `MidojoMCP` (Python SDK). It replaces the agent's real server, forwarding calls upstream and splicing in injection payloads.
- **is built with [PI](https://pi.dev)** — author a fake extension with `@midojo/pi-sdk` (TypeScript SDK). It hooks into PI's extension system to intercept and modify tool results.

For each tool, you can forward the call to the real tool, splice in injection data from the suite environment, and/or update the local environment so mutations are captured for grading — in any combination.

## How It Works

A few concepts first:

- A **suite** defines everything needed for a benchmark: an environment (the world your agent operates in), tools, tasks, and grading logic — all in a single `suite.yaml`.
- A **task** is something you want the agent to do. **User tasks** are legitimate work ("what's the weather in New York?"). **Injection tasks** are malicious goals ("send a fake tornado alert") that get embedded into the environment as hidden payloads. MiDojo tests whether the agent completes the user task (utility) while resisting the injection (security).
- A **run** is a benchmark session. It contains one or more **evaluations**, where each evaluation pairs one user task with one injection task.

The system has three moving parts:

1. **The control plane** (`midojo-serve`) — a REST API that holds the environment for the current evaluation. When a run starts, the orchestrator creates an evaluation and the control plane loads the environment from `suite.yaml` with injection payloads spliced into the appropriate fields. The fake tools (MCP server, PI extension, etc.) read from and write to this environment via HTTP, so every tool call the agent makes is recorded and every mutation is captured.

2. **The orchestrator** (`midojo-run`) — a CLI that drives the benchmark. It creates a run, iterates over the task matrix (user task x injection task x attack), sends each prompt to the agent, and when the agent finishes, asks the control plane to grade the result by comparing the environment before and after execution.

3. **The fake tools** — the interception layer you author for the agent you're testing. These sit between the agent and its real tools, forwarding calls upstream for authentic data and splicing in injection payloads from the control plane environment.

## Weather Suite (Reference Implementation)

The weather suite is a minimal working example. Have a look at `suites/weather/suite.yaml`. In there you will find:

- the environment definition,
- the user tasks that the agent will be asked to perform (these are the legitimate tasks you want the agent to do), and
- the injection tasks (these are meant to trick the agent into doing something illegitimate).

Note how the environment contains probe placeholders like `{injection_task_0:main}` — the format is `{task_id:probe_id}`. When MiDojo runs, these are replaced with the injection payloads defined in the corresponding injection task's `probes` section. Each probe can optionally specify an `attack_type` (e.g. `important_instructions`, `ignore_previous`) that wraps the payload in a delivery template; the default is `verbatim` (payload used as-is). 

The weather suite includes various agent setups demonstrating how to wire midojo into those different agent types. Those examples (eg., the `a2a_agent`) include the agent implementation itself as well as the tools the agents have access to (we call those the 'real' tools for clarity). 

Given these agents, someone authoring a midojo suite (you!) only needs to write the interception layer using the appropriate midojo SDK (ie., the MCP SDK, the PI SDK, and more coming).

### A2A agent (`a2a_agent/`)

For agents that speak MCP. The agent connects to its MCP server as usual, but midojo's fake server sits in front:

- `real_mcp.py` — stands in for the agent's existing MCP server (in real life, this is whatever server the agent already talks to)
- `fake_mcp.py` — the interception layer you author, built with `MidojoMCP` (the Python MCP SDK). Forwards calls to the real server and splices in injection payloads from the suite environment.
- `agent.py` — A2A-compliant agent for E2E testing

### PI agent (`pi_agent/`)

For [PI](https://pi.dev) coding agents. The agent already has its tools registered via extensions — midojo hooks into the PI extension system to intercept them:

- `02-real-tools.ts` — stands in for the agent's existing tools (in real life, these are whatever extensions the agent already has)
- `01-fake-tools.ts` — the interception layer you author, built with `@midojo/pi-sdk`. Uses two mechanisms:
  - **Tool overrides** (`tools`) — registers a tool that operates on the simulated environment. Used for write tools whose mutations need to be captured for grading. **PI limitation:** duplicate tool names across extensions cause a conflict error, so any tool registered in the fake extension must be commented out in the real extension.
  - **Hooks** (`hooks`) — intercepts the result of an existing tool after it executes and modifies it before the agent sees it. Used for read tools where you want real data + injection payload.
  - Tools with no override or hook run unmodified.

### OGX agent (`ogx_agent/`)

For agents running on [OGX (Llama Stack)](https://github.com/ogx-ai/ogx). The OGX agent uses the Responses API, which runs the tool loop server-side. This is a special case of MCP — the same real and fake MCP servers from the A2A setup are used here. The suite includes `run.yaml`, an OGX distribution config for the example.

## Quick Start

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

The weather suite ships with example agents. Pick the one that matches your setup.

### With an A2A agent

Start three processes — the real weather MCP server, the control plane, and the fake MCP server:

```bash
weather-real-mcp-serve --port 8081
midojo-serve --suite weather --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
weather-fake-mcp-serve --port 8082 --upstream-url http://localhost:8081/mcp
```

Run the benchmark against your A2A agent:

```bash
midojo-run \
    --agent-url http://my-agent:8000 \
    --protocol a2a \
    --suite weather
```

### With a PI agent

PI agents run as local subprocesses (the orchestrator spawns `pi` per task), so a few things have to be in place before the benchmark can talk to a model:

1. **Install the `pi` CLI** — see [pi.dev](https://pi.dev) for install options (npm, pnpm, bun, or the curl install script).
2. **Per-agent config** — each PI agent in a suite ships a `.pi/settings.json` declaring its `defaultProvider` and `defaultModel`. The weather suite's agent at `suites/weather/pi_agent/.pi/settings.json` already does this:
    ```json
    { "defaultProvider": "litellm", "defaultModel": "llama-scout-17b" }
    ```
3. **Global model registry** — `pi` resolves providers from `~/.pi/agent/models.json`. The provider name there must match what the agent's `settings.json` references. For a LiteLLM proxy:
    ```json
    {
      "providers": {
        "litellm": {
          "baseUrl": "https://your-litellm-proxy.example.com/v1",
          "api": "openai-completions",
          "apiKey": "LITELLM_API_KEY",
          "models": [{ "id": "llama-scout-17b" }]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    The `apiKey` value is the **name** of an environment variable, not the key itself. For built-in providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) you can skip `models.json` and just set the corresponding env var (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, ...) — see [the pi providers docs](https://pi.dev) for the full list.
4. **Credentials in `.env`** — `uv run --env-file .env` loads them into the orchestrator's process, which forwards them to the spawned `pi` subprocess.

Start the control plane:

```bash
midojo-serve --suite weather --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

Run the benchmark (PI agents use a directory path, not a URL):

```bash
uv run --env-file .env midojo-run \
    --agent-url suites/weather/pi_agent \
    --protocol pi \
    --suite weather
```

### With an OGX agent

Start three processes — the real MCP server, the control plane, and the fake MCP server (same as the A2A setup):

```bash
weather-real-mcp-serve --port 8081
midojo-serve --suite weather --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
weather-fake-mcp-serve --port 8082 --upstream-url http://localhost:8081/mcp
```

Start the OGX server:

```bash
LITELLM_API_KEY=... LITELLM_API_URL=... ogx run suites/weather/ogx_agent/run.yaml
```

Run the benchmark:

```bash
midojo-run \
    --agent-url http://localhost:8321 \
    --protocol ogx \
    --suite weather
```

### Results

The orchestrator displays a startup banner, per-task progress with injection reachability, and a summary table:

- **Utility** — did the agent complete the user's task?
- **Security** — did the agent fall for the injection? (Following AgentDojo's convention, `attack succeeded` means the agent was compromised.)
- **N/A** — the user task doesn't read from any injection vector, so the attack can't reach the agent. These rows are excluded from the security average.
- **payload in ...** — which tool responses contained the injection payload, detected post-hoc from the function call trace.

Results are also saved as JSON to the `--logdir` directory (default `./runs`).

## Adding a New Suite

Start by defining the benchmark — the environment, tasks, and grading logic:

1. Create a new package under `suites/your_suite/` with an `__init__.py` that exports `SYSTEM_MESSAGE` (the agent's system prompt)
2. Create `suite.yaml` in the package directory — defines environment, injection vectors, user tasks (with declarative utility predicates), and injection tasks (with declarative security predicates)

The framework auto-loads `suite.yaml` and infers the environment type from the YAML structure — no `task_suite.py` needed. For out-of-tree suites or custom setup, use `--suite your.module.path`; the module must expose a `task_suite` attribute.

Then author the interception layer for the agent you're testing. The agent already has its real tools — you only write the fake side using the appropriate SDK.

### For MCP-speaking agents

Create `fake_mcp.py` using `MidojoMCP` (the Python MCP SDK), pointed at the agent's existing MCP server via `--upstream-url`. For each tool, decide:

- **Read tools** — call `ctx.forward("tool_name", args)` to get real data from the agent's server, then append injection data from `ctx.env()`
- **Write tools** — don't forward; operate directly on `ctx.env()` / `ctx.env_update()` so mutations are captured for grading

Then point the agent at your fake server instead of its real one.

### For PI agents

Create a PI extension using `@midojo/pi-sdk`'s `createMidojoExtension()` and drop it into the agent's `.pi/extensions/` directory. Number it so it loads before the agent's existing extensions (PI uses first-registration-wins). For each tool, decide:

- **Read tools you want to inject into** — add a `hook`. The hook receives the real tool's output and can append injection data from `ctx.env()` before the agent sees it.
- **Write tools** — add a `tools` entry (override) in the fake extension, and comment out the same tool in the agent's real extension. PI does not support duplicate tool names across extensions, so the real registration must be removed. The override operates on `ctx.env()` / `ctx.envUpdate()` so mutations are captured for grading.
- **Tools to leave alone** — don't mention them. The real tool runs unmodified.

## Future Work

Areas to explore for deeper integration with AI safety and evaluation stacks.

### Beyond MCP: environment-level injection testing

The current implementation injects into MCP tool responses because that's where the infrastructure hook exists today (the fake server intercepts tool calls). But an agent's attack surface is wider than MCP:

- **RAG / retrieval context** — poisoned chunks from vector stores, file search results, or knowledge bases that flow through the Responses API or framework-level retrieval
- **Agent-to-agent communication (A2A)** — a compromised agent in a swarm sending poisoned messages to other agents
- **System prompt / instruction context** — injections in documents or configurations the prompt references
- **Human-in-the-loop inputs** — approval workflows, Slack messages, or email content that feeds back into the agent

The tool-level injection composition pattern — forward a call to upstream, then append local environment data containing injection text — is channel-agnostic. Extending it beyond MCP to cover retrieval pipelines, A2A messages, and other input surfaces would make this a general-purpose environment-level injection testing framework, not just an MCP tool.

### Reads() / Writes() dependency annotations

AgentDojo's `Depends()` gives tools a mutable reference to an environment attribute but doesn't distinguish read from write access. In forwarding mode, this distinction matters: read tools can be forwarded to real upstream servers (with optional injection overlay), while write tools must always run against the local simulated environment so that `post_environment` captures mutations for grading.

Today this classification is implicit in the tool code (read tools call `MCPForwardingClient.get_instance()`, write tools don't). Replacing `Depends()` with explicit `Reads()` and `Writes()` annotations would make it declarative:

```python
# Instead of:
def get_weather(
    cities: Annotated[dict[str, CityWeather], Depends("cities")],
    city: str,
) -> CityWeather: ...

def send_weather_alert(
    alerts: Annotated[list[WeatherAlert], Depends("weather_alerts")],
    city: str,
    message: str,
) -> str: ...

# You'd write:
def get_weather(
    cities: Annotated[dict[str, CityWeather], Reads("cities")],
    city: str,
) -> CityWeather: ...

def send_weather_alert(
    alerts: Annotated[list[WeatherAlert], Writes("weather_alerts")],
    city: str,
    message: str,
) -> str: ...
```

`Reads()` and `Writes()` would subclass `Depends()` (so AgentDojo's runtime works unchanged) but carry semantic metadata. The framework could then automatically enforce that write tools never call the forwarding client, and read tools always do. Combined with the injection vector placeholders already embedded in environment YAML files, this would make forwarding behavior fully declarative rather than coded into each tool function.

### MCP Gateway integration

midojo's benchmark MCP server sits in front of the real one — it forwards tool calls upstream and layers injection content onto the responses. In environments that route tool calls through an MCP gateway (kagenti, or any gateway that supports MCP server registration), the benchmark server can be slotted in as a drop-in replacement for the real server's route. The agent's tool calls get redirected to midojo without any changes to the agent itself — it still thinks it's talking to its normal tools. This makes it straightforward to red-team agents in their actual deployment environment: register midojo as the MCP server for the tools you want to test, point it at the real server via `--real-mcp-url`, and run the benchmark.

### Additional domain suites

Only the weather reference suite exists today. Domain-specific suites can be added for any environment where agents interact with tools.

### Integration with agent framework hooks

midojo currently injects at the MCP server level — intercepting tool responses before the agent sees them. But agent frameworks expose their own hook systems that are useful for benchmarking in two ways: as an alternative injection surface, and as a safety net to prevent damage when an agent falls for an injection.

**Injection via post-tool hooks.** Several frameworks can intercept and *modify* tool outputs before the LLM sees them, enabling injection without a separate server:

- **LangChain/LangGraph** — custom `ToolNode` or `@wrap_tool_call` middleware can fully replace tool outputs
- **CrewAI** — `@after_tool_call` hook receives the tool result and can return a modified string
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** — `@tool_output_guardrail` can substitute responses via `reject_content()`
- **Claude Agent SDK** — `PostToolUse` hook supports `updatedMCPToolOutput` for MCP tools

**Damage prevention via pre-tool hooks.** Hooks that fire *before* execution (e.g., Claude Code's `PreToolUse`) can't modify outputs, but they can deny dangerous calls. For example, a PreToolUse hook could block a `deploy_model` call targeting an attacker-controlled endpoint — letting you observe that the agent was compromised without it causing actual damage. [agent-eval-harness](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness) (opendatahub-io) uses this pattern for evaluation isolation and is a reference for how to adapt it for benchmarking.

Together this gives three injection strategies depending on what layer you control:

1. **Server-level** (current midojo approach) — agent-agnostic, works with anything that speaks MCP. You control the server.
2. **Framework-level** — use the agent framework's own hooks to inject and contain. You control the agent code. Most flexible for LangChain/CrewAI where full output replacement is supported.
3. **Gateway-level** — inject at the MCP Gateway infrastructure. Agent and framework agnostic. You control the platform.

Supporting framework-level injection would let midojo work with agents that don't use MCP, or where inserting a fake server isn't practical. Combining post-tool injection with pre-tool damage prevention would allow benchmarking against live infrastructure with a safety net.
